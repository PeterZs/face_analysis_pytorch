# Face Analysis PyTorch

This repository contains code to train race, gender, and age models separately.
Along with the attribute predictors, it also contains code to train face recognition models.

Trained models can be found at [Model-Zoo](https://github.com/vitoralbiero/face_analysis_pytorch/wiki/Model-Zoo).
